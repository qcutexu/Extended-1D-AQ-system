In this paper, we introduce an adapted one-dimensional (1D) reduced model aimed at analyzing blood flow within stenosed arteries. 
Differing from the prevailing 1D model \cite{Formaggia2003, Sherwin2003_2, Sherwin2003, Quarteroni2004, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-56288-4_10}, 
our approach incorporates the variable radius of the blood vessel. Our methodology begins with the non-dimensionalization of the Navier-Stokes equations 
for axially symmetric flow in cylindrical coordinates and then derives the extended 1D reduced model, by making additional adjustments to accommodate the 
effects of variable radii of the vessel along the longitudinal direction. Additionally, we propose a method to extract radial velocity information from 
the 1D results during post-processing, enabling the generation of two-dimensional (2D) velocity data. We validate our model by conducting numerical simulations 
of blood flow through stenotic arteries with varying severities, ranging from 23% to 50%. The results were compared to those from the established 1D model 
and a full three-dimensional (3D) simulation, highlighting the potential and importance of this model for arteries with variable radius. All the code used 
to generate the results presented in the paper is available at this https URL.
